General: 
-make dependencies tracking be an env var that makefile only sets if unset (and have it be more fault tolerant). 
-Test stuff on a real project.  
-Update blog about new testing procedure.
-logs: Write up that usually do logs inside scripts (so that you get them when running interactively). This is fine except for R (make sure this doesn't work well, look more into).
-update readme
-figure out the new v4 gph format.
-replace perl with python in conv tex lyx table (perl -0pe means split on null bytes, and input/print line by line)
-Allow someone to specifiy that certain files shouldn't be rebuilt (someone checks in a version that is good but takes a long time).

Implement in R/Matlab: 
-parallelization
-saving graphing info before backending.
-Show bring prefs in from pref-file.

Makefile:
-Evaluate useful with waf and https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates

remove the track-file crap (brach off). do a command to list just the deps, and list all changed since last program start.
note how the folder structure could be modified of econ-project-template
get econ-project-template to not use .dep's that have no rule
Automake a dta flow file.

Matlab:
-test dependency tracking. finish m_launcher
-See about normalizing files easily (blanking header)
-Finish putting in graphics rules.

Stata:
-Anthing to be done for .ster (estimates save) and .mmat files. The former look like re-packaged versions of the later (-estimates save- came in v10 after Mata in v9).
